✅ What to Check in Your Godot Project
In Godot > Project > Export, make sure you have a preset called Windows Desktop.

Make sure your preset path ends in .exe, like build/windows/game.exe.

Would you like me to automatically check and modify your export_presets.cfg file if you upload it? Or I can help generate a valid one for you.

I need both an Androing and Windows export

Perfect! If you want to export both Android (.apk) and Windows (.exe) builds, your GitHub Actions workflow needs to:

Set up Godot with export templates.

Export both platforms using the correct preset names (defined in export_presets.cfg).

Upload both files as build artifacts.

✅ Complete GitHub Actions Workflow (Windows + Android)
Here’s an updated and fully working workflow that builds both .exe and .apk files:
